README about the docker image
=============================

This part is dedicated to creating a docker image which includes the repo and a test environment.

You can review the docker image at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/dbwebb/sechat

The Makefile helps you rebuild the docker image and pushing it to, if you are allowed to do so, docker hub.

Feel free to revise the Dockerfile to make sure it is as small as possible and perhaps create another Dockerfile which uses Nginx instead of Apache, just for the fun of it.
